Docker learning

1)By default docker daemon listens on local unix socket called docker.sock in /var/run
If we check docker.sock in /run we can see that group owner is docker.So instead of needing
 to be root to run docker,we can add normal users to docker group(which owns docker socket).
 because docker group has full control of the unix socket.

2)For running docker container 
 docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
 docker run //run a docker container
 -it 		//make it interactive and assign TTY
 ubuntu 	//base a container on ubuntu image
 /bin/bash 	//inside the container we are going to run bash process
 
3)for checking the groups
cat /etc/group
 
4)For Adding a user(jithin) to group(docker)
sudo gpasswd -a jithin docker 

2375	//Standard non-SSL port for docker

5)We can look at the files in the filesystem
cat /etc/hosts		//We will get the hostname and ipaddress
ip a 				//for knowing the ipaddress
uname -a 			//for checking the kernel

6)For starting and going inside container which was already created
docker start <container-id> 	//for starting container
docker attach <container-id> 	//for going inside container

7)Docker engine
It is other name for docker daemon or docker runtime

8)Docker images
Docker images are from where we launch docker containers from.
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash  // here ubuntu will tells us the container will be based on ubuntu image.
If we have spun up new container,we are pulling it from docker hub(public docker registry).
Images are comprised of different layers.
While downloading the image,if we don't specify any version,it will automatically 
download the image that is tagged as latest version.
We use docker pull command to pull images from docker hub and store it locally.
docker pull -a ubuntu 	//for pulling all ubuntu images(all tags along with latest)
Once downloaded,images are stored on the host filesystem(/var/lib/docker/<storage drver>)

9)Docker Containers
They are launched from images.Containers are running instances of images.
Images are build time constructs where as containers are runtime constructs
Control P+Q		//Exiting the container without killing it.
docker ps 		//Running containers
docker ps -a 	//All the containers which ran on this host.

10)Docker Repositories and Registries
We pull images from repos and repos reside inside registries.
The default public registry for docker is docker hub.
Within docker hub,there are bunch of repos.
